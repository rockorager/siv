# siv design

siv (from Coheed and Cambria's *Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV*) is a
high-performance GUI toolkit for Linux. It is written in Zig, exports a stable C
ABI, and targets Wayland only.

This document records decisions, not aspirations. Each decision names the
requirement it serves, the alternatives considered, and the evidence that would
reverse it. "Another toolkit does it this way" is evidence, never a reason.

## Principles

1. **Design from first principles.** Every decision states the requirement it
   serves. Prior art (GTK, Qt, Chromium, Flutter, ourokit) informs; it does not
   decide.
2. **Performance is a requirement.** Budgets are measured in CI. An idle
   application costs nothing.
3. **No development shortcuts.** The first implementation of a subsystem is the
   real one: accessibility, input methods, color management, and failure paths
   are designed in, not added later.
4. **The C ABI is the product.** Every capability is reachable from C. Stock
   widgets use only public primitives.
5. **Small core, complete scope.** The core is a UI toolkit. Anything else is an
   optional module or out of scope.

## Decisions

### D1. Library with a stable C ABI

- **Requirement:** applications in any language can use siv, and the toolkit can
  be embedded in existing programs.
- **Decision:** siv is a shared library (`libsiv.so.N`) with a C ABI. Zig, Lua,
  and other bindings are generated from one API schema.
- **Alternatives:** an application host with a scripting language as the primary
  interface (ourokit); a Zig-only library.
- **Reverse if:** never; this is the product definition.

### D2. ABI conventions

- **Requirement:** foreign callers must be able to use the ABI safely and
  bindings must stay correct across versions.
- **Decision:**
  - Objects are generation-checked `uint64_t` handles, never pointers. A stale
    handle is a detectable error. Layout: type tag (8 bits, never 0, so a
    mistyped handle fails), root slot (10), generation (22), index (24).
    Objects belong to a root (the application); destroying the root
    invalidates every handle it issued.
  - Every descriptor struct begins with `size_t size`. Zero means default, so
    callers use designated initializers (`SIV_DESC(type, .field = v)` sets the
    size). Descriptors are passed by pointer (NULL means all defaults), are
    never embedded by value, only grow by appending fields, and have no
    padding. A smaller size (older headers) gets defaults for the missing
    fields; a larger size (newer headers) is accepted only if the unknown
    bytes are zero, otherwise `SIV_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED`; a size that ends inside
    a field is invalid. Value structs (points, colors) are frozen forever.
  - Strings are pointer and length; embedded NUL is allowed. siv copies what
    it keeps. Static strings siv returns are also NUL-terminated.
  - Callbacks take `void *user_data` as their first parameter; a callback
    parameter is followed by its `user_data`.
  - Fallible functions return `siv_result` (0 is success, errors negative),
    write outputs through trailing pointers only on success, and have no
    effect when they fail. Unknown enum values and flag bits are
    `SIV_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED`.
  - No global state; multiple applications per process are allowed. The one
    process-wide structure is a fixed, lock-free table of 1024 root slots
    that lets any handle be validated without its root. It holds no
    configuration and needs no initialization.
  - Allocation failure is an error result at every call, never an abort.
    Applications may supply allocator hooks (`siv_allocator`: alloc and free
    with size and alignment, plus user data) per root; every allocation for
    that root, including the root itself, goes through them. The hooks must
    be thread-safe: `siv_post` allocates on the calling thread (D5).
  - SONAME versioning, symbol versioning, and semantic versioning. The SONAME
    is `libsiv.so.<major>`. A generated version script exports exactly the
    schema's functions and hides everything else (including sanitizer
    runtimes). Before 1.0 every symbol carries the node of the current minor
    release (`SIV_0.1`), so a program linked against 0.1 fails to load
    against 0.2 instead of misbehaving; from 1.0 a symbol keeps the node of
    the release that added it. A build check compares the exported symbols,
    versions, and SONAME against the schema. Deprecation rules are written
    down before 1.0.
- **Alternatives:** GObject-style reference-counted objects with
  inheritance; raw pointers; a per-thread "last error" (global state, and
  lost across language boundaries); `libsiv.so.0.<minor>` SONAMEs before 1.0
  (lets 0.x releases coexist, but Zig's build names files by major only).
- **Reverse if:** generation checks show up in profiles on hot paths. Then
  check only at the ABI boundary in release builds (internal code already uses
  plain indices; see D20). Use per-minor SONAMEs if distributions need 0.x
  releases installed side by side.

### D3. One API schema generates every binding

- **Requirement:** the C header, Zig wrapper, Lua binding, documentation, and
  third-party bindings must never drift.
- **Decision:** a Zig schema (`src/abi/api.zig`, format in
  `src/abi/schema.zig`) describes every type and function. Build steps
  generate `siv.h`, the Zig wrapper, the Lua binding, reference documentation,
  a published JSON description for external generators, and the linker
  version script. libsiv's own exports use the generated Zig wrapper's types
  and are checked at compile time against the schema signatures, so the
  implementation cannot drift either. A test-only library built from a second
  schema exercises every construct through the same pipeline.
- **Alternatives:** hand-written header with bindings derived from it; GObject
  Introspection.
- **Reverse if:** the schema cannot express a needed ABI construct without
  special cases.

### D4. Retained tree mutated through transactions

- **Requirement:** accessibility, input methods, focus, and animation need stable
  identity across frames. Each frame must show a consistent state. Crossing the
  FFI boundary has a per-call cost.
- **Decision:** a retained tree of a small closed set of primitives (box, flex,
  grid, stack, text, editor, scroll/viewport, image, canvas, external surface).
  Mutations are batched in a transaction and applied atomically on commit.
  Declarative diffing, if wanted, is a helper above the tree, not a layer every
  update passes through.

  ```c
  siv_txn *t = siv_txn_begin(win);
  siv_node row = siv_flex(t, root, &(siv_flex_desc){ .axis = SIV_ROW, .gap = 8 });
  siv_text(t, row, "Hello", 5);
  siv_on(t, button, SIV_ACTIVATE, on_click, user);
  siv_txn_commit(t);
  ```
- **Alternatives:** immediate mode (no stable identity without hashing call
  sites); descriptions lowered through several intermediate representations
  (ourokit: description → descriptor → instance → render object).
- **Reverse if:** binding authors cannot express common UIs without a diffing
  layer; then ship the diffing helper, not a second tree.

### D5. Callbacks run only at safe points on the UI thread

- **Requirement:** no re-entrancy between I/O completion, layout, and application
  code.
- **Decision:** I/O and platform events only update state and mark work
  runnable. Application callbacks run at a defined phase of the loop.
  `siv_post` is the only call that is safe from any thread.
  - Each loop iteration runs, in order: poll; io (fd handlers, which only
    read, update state, and schedule tasks); timers; dispatch (closures from
    `siv_post`, worker-pool completions, then dispatch tasks); frame (layout,
    paint, present); prepare hooks before sleeping (Wayland flushes here).
    Work scheduled for a phase that already ran waits for the next iteration.
  - `siv_post` takes a callback, a destroy-notify, and user data. Posting
    allocates a node, so the loop's allocator must be thread-safe.
  - Worker jobs run on the application's one worker pool (`src/pool`, see
    D6); the loop's wrapper posts each completion to the loop, so `done` runs
    in the dispatch phase.
  - Destroying the application never runs pending posted closures or worker
    completions, since teardown has begun; it calls their destroy-notify (or
    a job's cancel function) so they can release what they own.
- **Alternatives:** callbacks from arbitrary threads (forces locking on every
  caller); running pending closures at teardown (runs application code
  against a half-destroyed application).
- **Reverse if:** never.

### D6. Embeddable event loop: epoll

- **Requirement:** hosts with their own loop (GLib, libuv, Qt, game loops) must
  be able to drive siv. siv must run inside sandboxes.
- **Decision:** one epoll loop per application with eventfd wakeups and timerfd
  deadlines from a userspace timer heap. `siv_app_fd()` and
  `siv_app_dispatch(timeout)` embed it; `siv_run()` owns it. File I/O runs on the
  worker pool.
  - The loop fd stays readable while any work is pending (the eventfd is
    written when work is scheduled for a phase that already ran), so an
    embedder only needs to poll it and call `siv_app_dispatch(0)`. An idle
    loop with no armed timers blocks indefinitely.
  - Worker threads start on demand up to a limit and block when idle.
  - One worker pool per application, shared by file I/O, decode, and raster
    tiles, so the loop and the renderer never oversubscribe the CPU. It has
    two modes on the same threads and queue: async jobs (completions
    delivered by the loop, D5) and blocking fork-join, in which the calling
    thread also runs the job and helpers that have not started when it
    finishes are dropped, so fork-join never waits behind queued I/O.
- **Alternatives:** io_uring. Rejected: a GUI client issues tens of syscalls per
  frame, so batching gains are negligible; Docker's default seccomp profile
  blocks io_uring, Android and ChromeOS disable it, and seccomp sandboxes cannot
  filter it.
- **Reverse if:** a measured workload shows syscall overhead in a frame budget,
  and io_uring is available in the target sandboxes.

### D7. libwayland, Wayland only

- **Requirement:** embedders need standard `wl_display*`/`wl_surface*` objects
  for Vulkan surfaces, GStreamer, libmpv, and EGL. No X11 users are targeted.
- **Decision:** libwayland-client, with zig-wayland generated bindings. No X11
  backend.
- **Alternatives:** Wayring (no ABI-compatible display objects, so no standard
  Vulkan swapchain and no third-party embedding).
- **Reverse if:** zig-wayland cannot track the Zig version siv requires; then
  generate bindings with siv's own scanner over the libwayland C API.

### D8. Compositor thread with a layer tree

- **Requirement:** scrolling and animation stay smooth while the UI thread is
  busy (application code, Lua, large layouts).
- **Decision:** one compositor thread per process owns a layer tree and all
  presentation. It runs scrolling and transform/opacity animations
  independently. The UI thread sends layer updates, not whole frames.
  The compositor thread renders CPU tiles through the application pool's
  fork-join mode and works on tiles itself, so it never blocks on the loop.
- **Alternatives:** render on the UI thread (lowest latency when idle, but any
  UI-thread stall drops frames); a plain render thread (adds a handoff without
  independent animation).
- **Reverse if:** measured input-to-photon latency regresses beyond one frame
  versus UI-thread rendering for idle applications.

### D9. Vector display list

- **Requirement:** one scene description must drive the CPU renderer, Vulkan,
  and PDF output for printing and export.
- **Decision:** immutable display lists of paths, gradients, images, text runs,
  clips, layers with opacity, 2D affine transforms, and backdrop blur. Steady-
  state frames allocate nothing. Paint-only changes skip layout. Damage is
  tracked per layer.
  - A list is a flat command sequence: `push`/`pop` open and close a layer
    (transform, clip, opacity, blend mode, forced isolation); fills (rect,
    rounded rect, or path with nonzero or even-odd), strokes, glyph runs,
    images, and backdrop blurs draw into the innermost layer. The stack form
    maps to PDF's q/Q, clipping paths, and transparency groups.
  - Colors are linear light, sRGB primaries, straight alpha. Paints are solid
    colors and linear, two-point conical, and sweep gradients; gradients
    interpolate premultiplied in linear light, and repeat/reflect use the
    stop range as the period (CSS, COLRv1).
  - Layer blend modes are the COLRv1 set (Porter-Duff and the W3C blend
    modes), because color glyphs lower into display lists. Modes that touch
    the destination where the source is transparent affect the layer's whole
    clip.
  - A backdrop blur blurs everything drawn before it in the nearest isolated
    layer, like CSS backdrop-filter.
  - Builders copy paths, stops, and glyphs into an arena that is reset per
    frame slot. Image pixels and fonts are referenced; their keys change when
    content changes and key backend caches.
  - Damage: layers with a nonzero id are matched across lists. A layer's
    version covers everything except its transform and opacity, including
    the order of its child layers. `scene.damage.Tracker` returns device
    rectangles (merged; more than 16 collapse to their bounds).
- **Alternatives:** pixel-only scene (cannot produce PDF).
- **Reverse if:** a construct cannot be lowered to all three backends. Watch:
  PDF has no sweep-gradient shading, so sweeps need a function-based shading
  or tessellation there.

### D10. CPU renderer and Vulkan renderer

- **Requirement:** headless tests, golden images, machines without suitable
  Vulkan, and high performance where the GPU is available.
- **Decision:**
  - CPU: tiled across the worker pool, presented through `wl_shm`. It is the
    golden-image oracle. Presented buffers are premultiplied ARGB8888, which
    every compositor supports; the 16-bit working space (D11) is converted
    when writing them.
  - CPU frames: one prepare pass on the calling thread (device transforms,
    flattened paths and strokes, premultiplied paints, glyph placement), then
    damaged 64×64 tiles run on workers into a persistent 16-bit linear
    framebuffer and are encoded into the output buffer. Keeping the
    framebuffer makes damage-only frames exact and lets a reused buffer's age
    damage be re-encoded without redrawing.
  - The renderer takes a fork-join `Executor` (run one job on N workers and
    wait). The application pool provides it (D6); `Executor.serial` renders
    inline, e.g. for color glyph bitmaps.
  - Coverage contract shared with Vulkan: exact box coverage for
    rectangles; rounded corners clamp(0.5 − d, 0, 1) at pixel centers,
    limited by box coverage; paths exact-area coverage after flattening to
    1/40 px, quantized to 8 bits.
  - Backdrop blur: render the backdrop region with the preceding commands on
    the same tile grid, blur it separably (an exact Gaussian up to σ = 2,
    three box passes above), clamp at the surface edge, and widen damage
    where changed pixels reach the backdrop.
  - Output: ARGB/XRGB/ABGR/XBGR 8888, 2101010, and 16161616, sRGB-encoded
    and premultiplied in encoded space. 8- and 10-bit outputs get an 8×8
    ordered dither anchored to device coordinates.
  - Golden images live in test/golden/render and are compared with a small
    tolerance (every channel within 3/255, at most 0.5% of pixels off by more
    than 1) to absorb cross-CPU rounding.
  - Vulkan 1.3 (dynamic rendering, synchronization2): instanced quads, analytic
    rounded rectangles and shadows, glyph and image atlases. Presentation uses
    the standard Vulkan Wayland swapchain.
  - Runtime fallback to CPU on `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` or GPU removal. Device
    selection on multi-GPU systems follows dma-buf feedback.
  - No OpenGL.
- **Alternatives:** compute-based vector rendering (higher latency and
  complexity than UI needs); Sokol (X11-only window glue, no exportable images);
  own dma-buf presenter (required only without libwayland).
- **Reverse if:** the standard swapchain blocks a measured requirement
  (resize synchronization, frame timing); then build the dma-buf presenter.

### D11. Color

- **Requirement:** correct compositing, HDR and wide-gamut output.
- **Decision:** linear-light working space (FP16 on Vulkan, 16-bit on CPU) and
  `wp_color_management_v1` for HDR and wide gamut. Text coverage gets a
  perceptual correction, because users compare text with gamma-space Linux text.
  - The text correction maps coverage so that linear blending reproduces
    gamma-space blending against a contrasting background (white behind
    dark text, black behind light text), from a table per foreground
    luminance (16 levels). Color glyphs are not corrected.
- **Alternatives:** gamma-space blending everywhere (incorrect gradients and
  alpha); pure linear text (looks thin).
- **Reverse if:** user testing prefers uncorrected linear text.

### D12. Frame clock

- **Requirement:** animations land on the presented frame; no wasted frames.
- **Decision:** one frame clock per surface driven by frame callbacks and
  presentation feedback, sampling animations at the predicted presentation time.
  Use `fifo-v1` and `commit-timing-v1` where available; tearing control is
  opt-in. Suspended or occluded surfaces produce no frames.
  - A frame runs when the application wants one and no frame callback is
    outstanding. A configure always forces a frame, even while suspended or
    waiting on a callback; if the application presents nothing, siv still
    acknowledges the configure and commits.
  - The predicted time is the first refresh after the last presentation that
    is still in the future (now plus one refresh before any feedback; the
    refresh comes from the output mode until feedback arrives). Presentation
    timestamps on another clock (weston uses `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW`) are
    converted to `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`, the loop's clock.
  - With `fifo-v1`, each animation frame waits for the previous commit's
    barrier so that no frame replaces one that was never shown; answers to
    configures do not wait. With `commit-timing-v1`, each commit carries its
    predicted presentation time, so it is never shown before the time its
    animations were sampled for.
- **Alternatives:** fixed-rate timers.
- **Reverse if:** never. Early risk: confirm frame callbacks and presentation
  feedback behave correctly alongside Mesa's FIFO present mode.

### D13. Text engine

- **Requirement:** correct complex-script text, async font loading, control over
  caching, and fixes without waiting on another project.
- **Decision:** siv's own paragraph engine:
  - Fontconfig for discovery and fallback candidates.
  - HarfBuzz (built in, without FreeType, GLib, or ICU integration) for shaping.
  - SheenBidi for UAX #9; uucode plus siv's UAX #14 and UAX #29 scanners, gated
    on the official conformance suites.
  - Font fallback chosen by actual `.notdef` output at grapheme boundaries.
  - Each run shaped with full paragraph context; L1–L2 reordering per line after
    break selection.
  - A text node owns a width-independent `ShapedParagraph`; a width change
    reruns only break selection and positioning into a `Layout`. The only cache
    is the font cache. Intermediates live in one arena per layout pass.
  - Unsafe-to-break line edges are reshaped inline.
  - Hyphenation from Liang patterns (check each pattern file's license); an
    optional Knuth–Plass breaker for document views.
  - Horizontal text only; vertical CJK is a non-goal.
  - The font cache never reads files. Fonts enter with caller-supplied bytes or
    as pending Fontconfig sources; shaping skips pending fonts and lists the
    ones it wanted, and the text node loads them on the worker pool and
    rebuilds its `ShapedParagraph`. A style's fallback chain is Fontconfig's
    coverage-trimmed sort for the query.
  - Fallback probes only fonts whose cmap (or Fontconfig charset, when
    pending) has the grapheme's first code point. A stretch of unrenderable
    graphemes goes to the first font that renders all of it, else grapheme by
    grapheme. Emoji presentation (UTS #51) prefers color or text faces.
  - SheenBidi resolves levels once per text; L1 and L2 run in siv on the stored
    levels and bidi classes, so no SheenBidi object outlives the analysis.
  - Line_Break, Word_Break, Script, and Script_Extensions are uucode extension
    fields built from the pinned UCD. Grapheme clusters keep uucode's one
    tailoring: an emoji modifier not after a modifier base is its own cluster.
  - One `hb_font_t` per face at font-unit scale, scaled per run, so sizes cost
    nothing. `ptem`-dependent shaping (`trak`) is not applied.
  - The cluster map is two caret stops per grapheme in visual order; ligatures
    split at GDEF caret positions, else evenly.
  - Not yet built: tab stops (a tab is four spaces wide), breaking inside an
    overlong word, hyphenation, and Knuth–Plass.
- **Alternatives:** Pango (GLib dependency, blocking font load, single-threaded
  layout objects); libraqm (no wrapping or fallback); Parley (Rust toolchain);
  kb_text_shape (no cluster mapping, so no editing).
- **Reverse if:** the engine cannot reach Pango-level correctness on the
  shaping and bidi test corpora.

### D14. Glyph rasterization without FreeType

- **Requirement:** identical CPU and Vulkan output, color glyphs, variable fonts.
- **Decision:** glyph outlines and COLRv1 paint go through HarfBuzz's draw and
  paint APIs into siv's coverage rasterizer, shared with paths. CBDT/sbix emoji
  decode through wuffs. Glyphs are cached by face, glyph, pixel size, and 1/4-
  pixel horizontal phase; Vulkan uploads CPU-rasterized coverage. Without
  hinting, baselines (and ideally x-heights) snap to pixels, small sizes get
  slight stem darkening, and text coverage gets a contrast correction. No LCD
  subpixel antialiasing.
  - The glyph cache belongs to the renderer and keys on the text engine's
    face content hash, so it never needs invalidation when faces are
    recreated. Color glyphs also key on the foreground color.
  - COLRv0/v1 paint lowers into a display list that the CPU renderer draws
    into a 16-bit bitmap; Vulkan uploads the same bitmaps.
  - At 32 px and below the x-height is scaled vertically to a whole pixel
    (at most ±8%). Stem darkening adds 0.25 px of stroke at 10 px and below,
    falling to none at 18 px. Both are first guesses for the evaluation
    below.
  - Runs under rotation, skew, non-uniform scale, or above 256 px draw their
    outlines as paths; color glyphs lose their colors there.
- **Alternatives:** FreeType with hinting.
- **Reverse if:** a side-by-side comparison with FreeType-hinted text (Inter and
  Noto at 11–13 px on 1× displays) shows unacceptable softness that the
  mitigations cannot fix.

### D15. Editor

- **Requirement:** caret, selection, IME composition, and grapheme/word movement
  without duplicate text state.
- **Decision:** the editor builds on the text `Layout`: cluster map, break data,
  and bidi levels. IME uses `text-input-v3`; xkbcommon compose sequences work
  without an IME. Masked fields keep values in locked, dump-excluded memory with
  no undo or IME.

### D16. Input

- **Requirement:** every Linux input device behaves correctly.
- **Decision:** the core event model covers high-resolution scrolling with axis
  source, touch, tablet tools and pads (`tablet-v2`), pinch/swipe/hold gestures,
  xkbcommon with compose, `text-input-v3`, pointer constraints and relative
  motion on request, and keyboard-shortcut inhibition on request. Kinetic
  scrolling is implemented in the toolkit using the scroll-stop event.
  - Key text omits C0 control characters and DEL; the keysym identifies those
    keys. A key that continues or cancels a compose sequence is delivered
    with `composing` set and no text, so shortcuts still see it.

### D17. Windows, popups, decorations, external content

- **Requirement:** native window behavior on every major compositor, and
  embedding of video and app-rendered GPU content.
- **Decision:**
  - Server-side decorations when `xdg-decoration` offers them; fully featured
    client-side decorations otherwise (shadows, resize edges, input regions,
    window menu). Applications may opt into client-side for header-bar layouts.
  - Every menu, tooltip, and combobox is an `xdg_popup` with positioner
    constraints and grabs.
  - External GPU content is a scene node. When the node is axis-aligned,
    rectangularly clipped, and opaque or topmost, it is promoted to a subsurface
    (zero-copy, `wp_viewporter`, compositor color management). Otherwise its
    dma-buf is imported as a texture. Embedders can receive a `wl_surface*` for
    their own Vulkan, EGL, GStreamer, or libmpv rendering.
  - Fractional scale, preferred buffer scale, output hotplug, `xdg-activation`,
    idle inhibit, `xdg-dialog`, toplevel icons, and session restore.

### D18. Accessibility

- **Requirement:** screen readers (Orca), magnifiers, and keyboard-only use work
  in every application.
- **Decision:** a semantics tree is mandatory: every widget declares a role.
  siv implements AT-SPI itself over its D-Bus implementation, including text,
  value, action, and selection interfaces, live-region announcements, and caret
  tracking. Tests query the semantics tree.
- **Alternatives:** AccessKit's Linux adapter (adds a Rust toolchain).
- **Reverse if:** AccessKit offers a C build without Rust and covers every
  interface listed above.

### D19. Desktop integration

- **Requirement:** applications behave correctly under Flatpak and follow
  desktop settings.
- **Decision:**
  - D-Bus is implemented natively on the event loop.
  - Settings come only from the portal (color scheme, accent, contrast, reduced
    motion, text scale, fonts, cursor theme and size), applied live, with built-
    in defaults when no portal runs.
  - Portals for files, URIs, notifications, printing, screen capture, global
    shortcuts, and the document portal. No built-in file chooser: the portal is
    the system chooser.
  - Clipboard and drag-and-drop negotiate MIME types, support primary
    selection, stream through the event loop, and enforce configurable size
    limits.
  - Lifecycle: `org.freedesktop.Application` activation and single instance.
  - System tray (StatusNotifierItem) is an optional module.
  - Images: wuffs (PNG, JPEG, GIF), libwebp, libavif with dav1d, libjxl.
    Decoding is async and decodes to the displayed size.
  - Icons follow the freedesktop icon theme specification, rendered by siv's
    SVG parser for the subset icon themes use.

### D20. Internal handles and module boundaries

- **Requirement:** internal code stays simple and fast.
- **Decision:** generation-checked handles exist only at the ABI boundary;
  internal code uses plain indices. The application coordinator only sequences
  phases; subsystems never move into it. The headless platform backend runs the
  same loop as Wayland.
- **Alternatives:** ourokit's generation checks everywhere and a coordinator
  that grew to 21.8k lines.

### D21. Internationalization

- **Requirement:** translators use standard tooling; formatting follows the
  locale.
- **Decision:** siv's own gettext `.mo` reader, CLDR plural rules and
  locale-aware number and date formatting generated from CLDR data, RTL
  mirroring of the whole UI (start/end everywhere, mirrored icons), and locale
  language tags passed into shaping.

### D22. Stock widgets

- **Requirement:** applications in every language get a complete widget set.
- **Decision:** stock widgets are written in Zig using only public primitives:
  buttons, text fields and areas, styled-text editor, virtualized list, tree,
  table, and grid with selection models, menus, popovers, dialogs, tabs, split
  panes, sliders, spin buttons, progress, toasts. Theming uses compiled design
  tokens plus runtime overrides, follows the portal accent and color scheme, and
  includes a high-contrast variant. Animation respects reduced motion.
- **Non-goal:** a full document model with embedded tables and images.

### D23. Lua 5.5

- **Requirement:** hot reload and user extension, optional for C users.
- **Decision:** `libsiv-lua`, a separate library built on the C ABI. No ambient
  globals; APIs come from `require("siv")`.

### D24. Developer tooling and tests

- **Decision:** the inspector is a separate siv application that attaches over a
  socket the target opens only when an environment variable enables it (tree,
  properties, semantics, layout overlays, repaint flashing, frame timing). Tests
  run the real loop on the headless backend, compare CPU golden images, and diff
  CPU against Vulkan output. `zig build test` stays hermetic; `zig build
  test-compositor` runs the Wayland backend against real compositors on their
  headless backends, one matrix entry per compositor, pinned through nixpkgs.

### D25. Project

- **License:** MIT. Every dependency is MIT, BSD, or Apache-2.0; binaries ship a
  NOTICES file.
- **Toolchain:** Zig 0.17.
- **Packaging:** every C dependency has a build option to use the system copy;
  the build installs pkg-config files.
- **Security:** continuous fuzzing of every parser (rasterizer inputs, SVG,
  image decoders, clipboard and drag-and-drop payloads, Wayland input).
- **Budgets enforced in CI:** first frame under 20 ms, input-to-photon within one
  frame, 120 Hz scrolling through a 100k-row virtual list, zero idle CPU and
  wakeups, fixed memory per window.

## Lessons from ourokit

| ourokit | siv |
| --- | --- |
| App host, Lua-first, no stable ABI | Library, C ABI first |
| Four UI representations with lowering between them | One retained tree, transactions |
| Stock controls in Lua | Stock widgets in Zig on public primitives |
| `app/` coordinator grew to 21.8k lines | Coordinator only sequences phases |
| Rendering on the loop thread | Compositor thread with independent animation |
| Generation checks everywhere | Only at the ABI boundary |
| MCP, HTTP, PAM, audio, secrets in core | Core is UI only |
| Accessibility deferred | Semantics tree and AT-SPI from the start |
| Three text caches, FreeType raster | Two stored text objects, one font cache, HarfBuzz draw |
| Wayring and a custom dma-buf presenter | libwayland and the standard Vulkan swapchain |
| Rust toolchain for SVG, optional Pixman | No Rust; own SVG subset; no Pixman |

Kept from ourokit: callbacks only at safe points, recursive cancellation
scopes, linear-light blending with one display-list contract, pinned Unicode
conformance tests, headless snapshot tests, performance benchmarks, and the
text algorithms.

## Early risks

1. Frame clock behavior alongside Mesa's FIFO present mode (D12).
2. Unhinted text quality on 1× displays (D14).
3. Standard swapchain limits on resize synchronization and frame timing (D10).

## Initial workstreams

These can proceed in parallel with disjoint ownership once the repository
skeleton and build exist.

| Workstream | Owns | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ABI schema and code generation | `src/abi/`, generated headers and bindings | Skeleton |
| Text engine | `src/text/` | Skeleton |
| Coverage rasterizer, display list, CPU renderer | `src/raster/`, `src/scene/`, `src/render/cpu/` | Skeleton |
| Event loop and Wayland platform with `wl_shm` | `src/loop/`, `src/platform/` | Skeleton |

The retained tree, layout, compositor thread, Vulkan renderer, accessibility,
and widgets follow once these foundations land.
